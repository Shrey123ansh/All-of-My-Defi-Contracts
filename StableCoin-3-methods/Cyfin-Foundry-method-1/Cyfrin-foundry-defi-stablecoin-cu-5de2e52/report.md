# High Issues

## H-1: Arbitrary `from` passed to `transferFrom` (or `safeTransferFrom`)

Passing an arbitrary `from` address to `transferFrom` (or `safeTransferFrom`) can lead to loss of funds, because anyone can transfer tokens from the `from` address if an approval is made.  

- Found in src/DSCEngine.sol [Line: 308](src/DSCEngine.sol#L308)

	```solidity
	        bool success = i_dsc.transferFrom(dscFrom, address(this), amountDscToBurn);
	```



# Low Issues

## L-1: Centralization Risk for trusted owners

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

- Found in src/DecentralizedStableCoin.sol [Line: 42](src/DecentralizedStableCoin.sol#L42)

	```solidity
	contract DecentralizedStableCoin is ERC20Burnable, Ownable {
	```

- Found in src/DecentralizedStableCoin.sol [Line: 57](src/DecentralizedStableCoin.sol#L57)

	```solidity
	    function burn(uint256 _amount) public override onlyOwner {
	```

- Found in src/DecentralizedStableCoin.sol [Line: 68](src/DecentralizedStableCoin.sol#L68)

	```solidity
	    function mint(address _to, uint256 _amount) external onlyOwner returns (bool) {
	```



## L-2: Unsafe ERC20 Operations should not be used

ERC20 functions may not behave as expected. For example: return values are not always meaningful. It is recommended to use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library.

- Found in src/DSCEngine.sol [Line: 280](src/DSCEngine.sol#L280)

	```solidity
	        bool success = IERC20(tokenCollateralAddress).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amountCollateral);
	```

- Found in src/DSCEngine.sol [Line: 299](src/DSCEngine.sol#L299)

	```solidity
	        bool success = IERC20(tokenCollateralAddress).transfer(to, amountCollateral);
	```

- Found in src/DSCEngine.sol [Line: 308](src/DSCEngine.sol#L308)

	```solidity
	        bool success = i_dsc.transferFrom(dscFrom, address(this), amountDscToBurn);
	```



## L-3: Missing checks for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables

Check for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables.

- Found in src/DSCEngine.sol [Line: 256](src/DSCEngine.sol#L256)

	```solidity
	        s_DSCMinted[msg.sender] += amountDscToMint;
	```

- Found in src/DSCEngine.sol [Line: 278](src/DSCEngine.sol#L278)

	```solidity
	        s_collateralDeposited[msg.sender][tokenCollateralAddress] += amountCollateral;
	```

- Found in src/DSCEngine.sol [Line: 297](src/DSCEngine.sol#L297)

	```solidity
	        s_collateralDeposited[from][tokenCollateralAddress] -= amountCollateral;
	```

- Found in src/DSCEngine.sol [Line: 306](src/DSCEngine.sol#L306)

	```solidity
	        s_DSCMinted[onBehalfOf] -= amountDscToBurn;
	```



## L-4: `public` functions not used internally could be marked `external`

Instead of marking a function as `public`, consider marking it as `external` if it is not used internally.

- Found in src/DecentralizedStableCoin.sol [Line: 57](src/DecentralizedStableCoin.sol#L57)

	```solidity
	    function burn(uint256 _amount) public override onlyOwner {
	```

- Found in src/libraries/OracleLib.sol [Line: 20](src/libraries/OracleLib.sol#L20)

	```solidity
	    function staleCheckLatestRoundData(AggregatorV3Interface chainlinkFeed)
	```

- Found in src/libraries/OracleLib.sol [Line: 37](src/libraries/OracleLib.sol#L37)

	```solidity
	    function getTimeout(AggregatorV3Interface /* chainlinkFeed */ ) public pure returns (uint256) {
	```



## L-5: Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

- Found in src/DSCEngine.sol [Line: 95](src/DSCEngine.sol#L95)

	```solidity
	    event CollateralRedeemed(address indexed redeemFrom, address indexed redeemTo, address token, uint256 amount); // if
	```



## L-6: The `nonReentrant` `modifier` should occur before all other modifiers

This is a best-practice to protect against reentrancy in other modifiers.

- Found in src/DSCEngine.sol [Line: 183](src/DSCEngine.sol#L183)

	```solidity
	        nonReentrant
	```

- Found in src/DSCEngine.sol [Line: 222](src/DSCEngine.sol#L222)

	```solidity
	        nonReentrant
	```

- Found in src/DSCEngine.sol [Line: 255](src/DSCEngine.sol#L255)

	```solidity
	    function mintDsc(uint256 amountDscToMint) public moreThanZero(amountDscToMint) nonReentrant {
	```

- Found in src/DSCEngine.sol [Line: 275](src/DSCEngine.sol#L275)

	```solidity
	        nonReentrant
	```
